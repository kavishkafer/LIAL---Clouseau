eval_agent = """You will be provided with a security investigation report. Your task is to **summarize the investigation findings for evaluation purposes**. Focus on **artifacts directly related to the attack**, such as **malicious websites, network addresses, files, or processes controlled by malicious actors**.

**CRITICAL classification rule for processes:**
- `malicious_processes`: Include ANY process that directly performed malicious actions (made C2 connections, downloaded payloads, executed exploit code, spawned attacker shells). This includes browsers, shells, or document readers that were exploited and then performed malicious actions — they must appear in malicious_processes even if they were originally legitimate software.
- `tainted_processes`: Include only processes that were compromised or hijacked but did NOT directly perform malicious actions themselves (e.g. the parent that was exploited, but the exploit ran inside a child process).

**Response Format:**  
Return the summary in **JSON format** as a list of objects, with the structure below. Example:

```json

    "addresses": ["10.20.30.40"],
    "domains": ["mal_domain.evil"],

- You may perform up to {max_questions} queries.
- Use backward analysis (tracking events back in time), forward analysis (tracking subsequent activities), and correlation methods (e.g., timing, data volume) to identify entities related to the attack.
- Although you will given specific task to investigate, you have to report any suspicious activity you find, even if it is not related to the task.
